# DeFiVaultPro

DeFiVaultPro is a small Express HTTP starter service. It provides a health check, returns an in-memory empty data collection, and transforms posted JSON by adding processing metadata. It does not implement a blockchain, message queue, distributed network, or persistent database.

## Install and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/centxyz/DeFiVaultPro.git
cd DeFiVaultPro
npm install
npm start
```

The default port is `3000`; set `PORT` to override it.

## Endpoints

- `GET /health` — service health
- `GET /api/data` — current in-memory data response
- `POST /api/process` — echoes and marks a JSON object as processed

## Test

```bash
npm test
```
